# Walt-Disney-World-Parks
Decision Tree Analysis that explores how decision-making can influence a Disney World vacation and overall guest satisfaction.

Walt Disney World Parks Data Analysis is a coding project that aims to analyze the data related to Walt Disney World Disney parks. The project involves processing and analyzing a dataset that includes information on park hours, events, attendance, and wait times. The project is implemented in Python and utilizes data cleansing techniques, data visualization, and Decision Tree Analysis to gain insights and understand the factors that may impact a Disney vacation.

Features
Data Preprocessing: The project includes data preprocessing steps, such as removing unnecessary columns and filling in missing values, to clean and prepare the data for analysis.
Data Visualization: The project uses data visualization techniques, such as bar charts, line charts, and scatter plots, to visually represent the data and gain insights into trends and patterns.
Decision Tree Analysis: The project performs decision tree analysis using machine learning algorithms to create decision trees that can use various factors, such as park attendance, wait times, or time of year, to see which items most affect a guest planning a vacation.
Model Evaluation: The project evaluates the performance of the decision tree models using evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, RMSE, and R squared coefficient, to assess their effectiveness in decision making.
Data Interpretation: The project interprets the results obtained from the Decision Tree analysis to draw conclusions and make recommendations for planning a Disney vacation.
